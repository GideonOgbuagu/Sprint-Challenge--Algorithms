#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) n^3 / n^2 = n * n * n / n * n = n
    The Linear time is 0(n)


b) 0(n logn) => n input multiplied by j increment which increases by 2 compared to the next n input nesting inside the for loop


c) 0(n)

## Exercise II

Binary Search Tree
0(logn)
